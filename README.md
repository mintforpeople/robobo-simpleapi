# ROBOBO Simple API #

Robobo is an educational robot made up of a wheeled base that transports a smartphone, which provides Robobo with high level sensing, communications and processing capabilities, and that controls the base actuators.

The Robobo simple API provides a set of high level functions that allows programmers with no previous experience in programming to start developing applications using Robobo. There are two different approaches available: one using the drag-and-drop block based interface of App Inventor, and another using Java.
